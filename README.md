## Order&delivery Mgmt

The idea of this project is to build an “order & delivery” software that can be used by various small online vendors. All orders’ information(i.e customer’ details, delivery location, expected time of delivery and actual time of delivery) are saved in the database and can be shared with delivery agents.

It is a greenfield project that follows a typical client-server architectural pattern. The client makes a request and the Graphql server with connected database provides a response.
